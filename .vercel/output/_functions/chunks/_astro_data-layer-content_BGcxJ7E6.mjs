This project, developed by Luciano Azzigotti and Nemanja Radivojević, bridges historical computer music practices with live-coding paradigms, providing a platform for real-time sound synthesis and performance. At its core, _M5live_ is a tribute to one of the foundational tools in electronic music history, while simultaneously being an open framework for creative experimentation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/O19mwuO.png)\n\n\n## The Historical Foundation: MUSIC V\n\nIntroduced in 1967, Max Mathews’ **MUSIC V** was a landmark development in computer music. It allowed composers to algorithmically generate and process sounds through a flexible coding language. However, the limitations of early hardware meant that MUSIC V required significant computational resources and expertise to use. Despite these constraints, it became a cornerstone for the development of computer music systems, influencing generations of audio programming tools.\n\n_M5live_ takes the logic and principles of MUSIC V and places them in a contemporary, accessible environment, maintaining its aesthetic and operational philosophy while adapting it for live, interactive usage.\n\n## Technical Implementation of M5live\n\nThe system design of _M5live_ integrates several modern technologies to recreate the principles of MUSIC V in a browser-based application:\n\n- **ace.js**: This lightweight code editor allows users to write and modify MUSIC V-style code directly within their web browser. Its integration ensures a fluid, real-time coding experience suitable for both live performances and individual exploration.\n- **p5.js**: By integrating p5.js, the platform provides a visual layer that enhances the performative aspects of _M5live_. Visual feedback complements the sonic output, making it ideal for live-coding sessions where real-time interactivity is essential.\n- **WebAudio API**: The audio engine leverages the WebAudio API, offering low-latency audio synthesis and processing capabilities directly in the browser. This eliminates the need for additional software installations and keeps the platform lightweight and portable.\n- **GFortran**: At the heart of _M5live_ is a Fortran-based implementation, preserving the computational core of MUSIC V. GFortran compiles user-generated code, ensuring that the syntax and operational rules of the original system are faithfully maintained.\n\n## Core Functionalities\n\n_M5live_ enables a range of functionalities that merge the historical and contemporary:\n\n- **Real-Time Coding**: Users can modify code while the system is running, enabling dynamic changes to sound synthesis parameters and behavior.\n- **Preset Libraries**: Built-in libraries include examples from historical figures like Jean-Claude Risset, providing a direct link to seminal works in computer music.\n- **Collaborative Possibilities**: While currently a single-user environment, the underlying architecture is suitable for adaptation to collaborative live-coding systems.\n- **Performance-Oriented Design**: The integration of a code editor, visual feedback, and sound output within a single interface makes _M5live_ particularly suited for live performances and demonstrations.\n\n## The Role of Positionality in M5live\n\nOne of the more intriguing aspects of _M5live_ is its intentional historical framing. Rather than merely recreating the functionality of MUSIC V, it situates the software within a broader narrative of electronic music evolution. By embedding examples and paradigms from the 1960s into a contemporary framework, _M5live_ invites users to reflect on how technological tools shape artistic practice over time.\n\n## Contributions to the Field\n\n_M5live_ stands out in the field of electronic music software for several reasons:\n\n1. **Educational Value**: It provides an accessible way to study the principles of early computer music systems, making it a valuable tool for pedagogy in music technology and digital humanities.\n2. **Live-Coding Integration**: By bridging historical software paradigms with live-coding culture, _M5live_ positions itself as a unique intersection of past and present in electronic music.\n3. **Preservation and Transformation**: The project is as much about preserving a historical artifact as it is about transforming it into a medium for contemporary artistic expression.\n\n## Future Directions\n\nThe current implementation of _M5live_ highlights its potential, but it also opens doors for future enhancements:\n\n- **Multiplayer Functionality**: Expanding the platform to support collaborative live-coding sessions could align _M5live_ with tools like Sonic Pi and TidalCycles.\n- **Enhanced Visual Integration**: Further development of p5.js-based visuals could deepen the performative dimension.\n- **Hardware Integration**: MIDI or OSC support could broaden its appeal for live performers using external controllers.\n\n## Concluding Remarks\n\n_M5live_ is more than a mere historical revival—it is a recontextualization of a foundational tool for a new era of electronic music practice. By embedding the essence of MUSIC V into a modern framework, it encourages both reflection on the origins of computer music and experimentation with its future possibilities. For practitioners, researchers, and educators, _M5live_ is an invitation to engage deeply with the evolving relationship between technology and sound.","src/content/research/m5live.md","aff100dffaef26c1",{html:105,metadata:106},"<h1 id=\"m5live-revitalizing-music-v-for-contemporary-exploration\">M5live: Revitalizing MUSIC V for Contemporary Exploration</h1>\n<p><em>M5live</em> is a web-based environment that reimagines Max Mathews’ influential MUSIC V software for modern use.

The *Phosphorbone* is a hybrid aerophone fusing additive manufacturing, photoluminescent polymers, embedded microelectronics, and autopoietic amplification. Luminescence emerges as an indeterminate byproduct of the instrument's material-acoustic-energetic nexus, eschewing representational audiovisual overlays.\n\nThe design frames the instrument as an opaque technics, resisting hermeneutic transparency: sonic, gestural, feedback, and optical domains entangle in a nonlinear causal mesh. Drawing on historical precedents, speculative ontology, and iterative prototyping, it advances an organology prioritizing material autonomy, sensory surplus, and existential flux.\n\n## Philosophical Introduction: Luminous Instruments\nMusic-light intersections historically emphasize isomorphism and transduction—e.g., Scriabin's synesthetic harmonization in Prometheus or Kastner's pyrophon, where flame yields sound yet light remains ancillary. Optical apparatuses like the camera obscura, conversely, privilege photonic regimes sans acoustics, entrenching modal silos.\n\nThis work inverts such paradigms: light manifests as residual efflux, not encoded signifier—photoluminescent excitation accrues as temporal hysteresis, manifesting delayed phosphorescence and heterogeneous decay. The instrument obfuscates its mechanics, aligning with accelerationist anti-semantics (per Land), valorizing systemic evasion of interpretative closure. It embodies contradiction: aero-acoustic yet cybernetic, determinate yet chaotic, where luminescence disrupts rather than denotes.\n\n## Technical Breakdown\nThe instrument comprises a photoluminescent PLA 3D-printed aerophone chassis with extended slide kinematics, retaining core pneumatic excitation while augmenting via sensing and re-injection.\n\n### Hardware Architecture\n- Chassis: FDM-printed in SrAl2O4-doped PLA for persistent afterglow\n- Transduction: Piezoelectric film mic integrated in resonant cavity\n- Processing: ESP8266 SoC for ADC, DSP (RMS/envelope/FFT bins), and PWM output\n- Actuation: Miniature electrodynamic driver in bell cavity\n- Power: 5V LiPo with DC-DC regulation\n\n### Signal Flow\n- Piezo acquires structural modes and aero-vibrations\n- MCU computes time-frequency features (e.g., spectral centroid, flux)\n- Derived signals (phase-locked or granular) re-enter via driver\n- Driver induces self-excitation of chassis, not external projection\n\n### Self-Amplification Principle\nConfigured as a Karplus-Strong-like recursive loop with gain scheduling to avert runaway feedback, it hybridizes acoustic eigenmodes with electronic poles/zeros. Photoluminescence passively logs vibrational energy via dopant excitation, yielding non-isomorphic optical traces sans explicit mapping.\n\n## Methodological Development\nLeveraging FDM as organological epistemology, the approach extends Zoran's parametric wind instrument research, treating topology, rheology, and rastering as sonic operands. Empirical data on thermoplastic acoustics—e.g., surface Ra influencing boundary-layer diffusion, infill lattices (gyroid/hex) modulating Q-factor and modal density—validate FDM over subtractive methods for anisotropic resonators.\n\nMetamaterial extensions exploit subwavelength resonant phenomena to modulate acoustic behavior beyond the limits of homogeneous materials. At the scale of the resonator, classic mechanisms such as Helmholtz resonance ($f=\\frac{c}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{V L_{\\mathrm{eff}}}}$) provide a first model for coupling cavity volume, aperture geometry, and effective neck length, while interference-based processes—Mie and Fabry–Pérot resonances, together with Bragg scattering ($2d\\sin\\theta=n\\lambda$)—enable bandgap engineering, directional filtering, and partial acoustic cloaking. These principles prefigure lattice-embedded prototypes in which digitally fabricated infills, such as Voronoi networks or triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS), act as acoustic metamaterials whose macroscopic response emerges from micro-geometry rather than bulk composition.\n\nWithin these lattices, re-entrant honeycombs and chiral helicoidal structures can induce auxetic mechanical behavior, characterized by negative Poisson’s ratios ($\\nu<0$), directly affecting vibrational coupling and energy transfer. At a higher level of organization, periodic phononic crystals may host topologically protected edge states, formally described by invariants such as the Chern number ($C=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int\\Omega(k)\\,d^2k$), which stabilize certain vibrational modes against defects and fabrication tolerances. In aerophones, analogous ideas appear through fractal or labyrinthine air channels that enable strong wavefront bending and, in extreme regimes, effective negative refraction or refractive index, allowing compact geometries to reorganize internal pressure fields.\n\nAdditive manufacturing further enables precise control over dispersion relations through tuned resonant elements such as quarter-wave tubes ($f=\\frac{c}{4L}$) and coupled cavity arrays, yielding pseudo-harmonic spectra, selective partial damping, and extended timbral regions. Comparable effects arise in hybrid systems, for example magnetically constrained membranes exhibiting mid-frequency bandgaps (on the order of a few hundred hertz), or mass-loaded strings whose added inertia produces degenerated vibrational modes and spectral flattening. Across these cases, material choice and geometry co-determine acoustic outcome, shifting timbre from a byproduct of construction to an explicit design variable.\n\nMethodologically, the approach is abductive rather than strictly predictive. Fabrication parameters—layer adhesion, extrusion multipliers, print-induced anisotropy, or multimaterial gradients—are iteratively probed using effective-medium approximations and finite-element methods, including analyses of mobility functions and thermoviscous losses ($\\alpha\\propto\\omega^2$). These simulations are complemented by psychoacoustic assays, treating instability not as an error to be eliminated but as a productive condition for ergodic exploration of the instrument’s state space. Evaluation therefore integrates quantitative metrics (SPL, THD, absorption coefficients) with enactive phenomenology, emphasizing the performer’s embodied negotiation of emergent, materially mediated acoustic behaviors.\n\n\n\n## Roadmap\n1.

Drawing on historical precedents, speculative ontology, and iterative prototyping, it advances an organology prioritizing material autonomy, sensory surplus, and existential flux.</p>\n<h2 id=\"philosophical-introduction-luminous-instruments\">Philosophical Introduction: Luminous Instruments</h2>\n<p>Music-light intersections historically emphasize isomorphism and transduction—e.g., Scriabin’s synesthetic harmonization in Prometheus or Kastner’s pyrophon, where flame yields sound yet light remains ancillary. Optical apparatuses like the camera obscura, conversely, privilege photonic regimes sans acoustics, entrenching modal silos.</p>\n<p>This work inverts such paradigms: light manifests as residual efflux, not encoded signifier—photoluminescent excitation accrues as temporal hysteresis, manifesting delayed phosphorescence and heterogeneous decay. The instrument obfuscates its mechanics, aligning with accelerationist anti-semantics (per Land), valorizing systemic evasion of interpretative closure. It embodies contradiction: aero-acoustic yet cybernetic, determinate yet chaotic, where luminescence disrupts rather than denotes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"technical-breakdown\">Technical Breakdown</h2>\n<p>The instrument comprises a photoluminescent PLA 3D-printed aerophone chassis with extended slide kinematics, retaining core pneumatic excitation while augmenting via sensing and re-injection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hardware-architecture\">Hardware Architecture</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Chassis: FDM-printed in SrAl2O4-doped PLA for persistent afterglow</li>\n<li>Transduction: Piezoelectric film mic integrated in resonant cavity</li>\n<li>Processing: ESP8266 SoC for ADC, DSP (RMS/envelope/FFT bins), and PWM output</li>\n<li>Actuation: Miniature electrodynamic driver in bell cavity</li>\n<li>Power: 5V LiPo with DC-DC regulation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"signal-flow\">Signal Flow</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Piezo acquires structural modes and aero-vibrations</li>\n<li>MCU computes time-frequency features (e.g., spectral centroid, flux)</li>\n<li>Derived signals (phase-locked or granular) re-enter via driver</li>\n<li>Driver induces self-excitation of chassis, not external projection</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"self-amplification-principle\">Self-Amplification Principle</h3>\n<p>Configured as a Karplus-Strong-like recursive loop with gain scheduling to avert runaway feedback, it hybridizes acoustic eigenmodes with electronic poles/zeros. Photoluminescence passively logs vibrational energy via dopant excitation, yielding non-isomorphic optical traces sans explicit mapping.</p>\n<h2 id=\"methodological-development\">Methodological Development</h2>\n<p>Leveraging FDM as organological epistemology, the approach extends Zoran’s parametric wind instrument research, treating topology, rheology, and rastering as sonic operands. Empirical data on thermoplastic acoustics—e.g., surface Ra influencing boundary-layer diffusion, infill lattices (gyroid/hex) modulating Q-factor and modal density—validate FDM over subtractive methods for anisotropic resonators.</p>\n<p>Metamaterial extensions exploit subwavelength resonant phenomena to modulate acoustic behavior beyond the limits of homogeneous materials. At the scale of the resonator, classic mechanisms such as Helmholtz resonance (<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math

Comparable effects arise in hybrid systems, for example magnetically constrained membranes exhibiting mid-frequency bandgaps (on the order of a few hundred hertz), or mass-loaded strings whose added inertia produces degenerated vibrational modes and spectral flattening. Across these cases, material choice and geometry co-determine acoustic outcome, shifting timbre from a byproduct of construction to an explicit design variable.</p>\n<p>Methodologically, the approach is abductive rather than strictly predictive.

These simulations are complemented by psychoacoustic assays, treating instability not as an error to be eliminated but as a productive condition for ergodic exploration of the instrument’s state space.

online platform that leverages AI to create and visualize organograms for musical instruments, blending speculative instrumental invention with structured organological analysis. Inspired by Mantle Hood’s organograms, SOOG employs a graph-based data structure to represent instruments (nodes) and their taxonomic, functional, or cultural connections (edges). This approach formalizes speculative organology as a distributed cognitive process (shared by human and non-human agents), a generative and performative network that enables computational exploration of instrument thinking, classification, and cross-cultural diffusion. The AI integrates hierarchical realms (speculative, fictional, or conceptual ideas) with non-hierarchical realms (the structured domains of playable instrument components), deliberately preserving ambiguity where traditional classification systems tend to collapse complexity.\n\n  \n\nMantle Hood’s [organogram](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319560743_Musical_Organics_A_Heterarchical_Approach_to_Digital_Organology) emerged as a response to the limitations of static, lineage-based classification systems such as Sachs–Hornbostel. Rather than asking what an instrument is in a taxonomic sense, Hood proposed a functional diagram that asks how an instrument operates as a system. His organograms decompose instruments into interacting domains such as *sound production*, *interface* *excitation*, *control*, *resonance*, and *cultural context*, emphasizing process, performative **affordance**, and internal relations over typological labels. The organogram is therefore not a taxonomy but a functional instrumental score: a way to visualize instrumental components as an operational configuration.\n\n  \n\nUnderstanding this shift is essential to understanding the strength of SOOG. SOOG does not merely reference Hood’s organograms as a historical model; it extends their logic into a computational, generative environment. By translating functional relations into graph structures, SOOG turns the organogram into an active system that can be queried, recombined, simulated, and expanded beyond existing instruments. What was originally an analytical diagram becomes, in SOOG, a productive engine: capable of generating speculative instruments, tracing hybrid genealogies, and negotiating between physical components, materials, gestures, and cultural imaginaries. Without grasping Hood’s move from classification to function, SOOG risks being misread as another taxonomy tool, rather than what it actually is: a framework for instrumental thought that operates across analysis, invention, and fabrication.\n\n\n\nIn its first stage, SOOG generates symbolic organograms that combine acoustic and augmented instrument designs with contemporary technological elements. In the second stage, it produces data-informed outputs, including material suggestions, 3D models, and schematics tailored for digital fabrication. Key applications include dynamic taxonomy generation, modeling of cultural transmission, and predictive instrument innovation, linking object-oriented composition, music, and future design practices to a deeper, functionally grounded organological understanding.\n\n\n\n## Original Mantle Hood prompt (experimental setup)\n\n  \nThis section documents a controlled experiment in which the SOOG model was fine-tuned using the methodological instructions found in [[hoodEthnomusicologist1982]]. The aim is to test how SOOG responds when given Mantle Hood’s original textual description of an African xylophone, and to compare the resulting organogram with Hood’s own graphical formulation.\n\n  \n\n### Mantle Hood organological description**\n\n\n\nThe following text is Mantle Hood’s original descriptive summary of an African xylophone, used here verbatim as a prompt. It condenses performer posture, playing technique, material classification (HSM), and resonator modification into a compact organological statement.\n\n```python\nResonator modified by membrane attachment (e.g., spider egg case in African xylophone gourd resonator producing buzz)—summary: player standing or seated on ground; instrument in horizontal position and supported by rail with body strap; 12 (#12) wooden (HSM 5) keys played with two padded sticks; gourd (HSM 1) resonators suspended singly and modified by attached membranes\n```\n\n![|400](https://i.imgur.com/9MLyHCE.png)\n\n### SOOG-generated interpretation and organogram reasoning\n\n  \nThis section presents SOOG’s response when prompted with Mantle Hood’s original description. The model reformulates the textual data into a step-by-step organogram construction, explicitly translating organological features into geometric primitives, interface elements, and performative relations, revealing both its interpretative logic and its divergence from Hood’s original graphical conventions.\n\n```python\nResonator modified by membrane attachment (e.g., spider egg case in African xylophone gourd resonator producing buzz)—description: player standing or seated on ground; instrument in horizontal position and supported by rail with body strap; 12 (#12) wooden (HSM 5) keys played with two padded sticks; gourd (HSM 1) resonators suspended singly and modified by attached membranes\n\nAlright, let's start by abstracting the shapes. The instrument is mainly a xylophone that falls within the category of Idiophones, so we'll depict that as a square. The resonator is a gourd which is attached by a membrane, and the performer's position is standing or seated on the ground. We'll represent the player's position with a dotted line and a small white circle. There's also a rail with a body strap, which we'll represent with another geometric shape.\n\nFor the interface, there are 12 wooden keys played with two padded sticks, represented by a different color.\n\nLastly, to indicate movements, we will use arrows.

These fragments are then played back in the video by varying their speed, direction and start time (annotated on the lower line). Each color correspond to a different buffer.\nThe video is organized in two symmetrical overlapping layers, one of them is the direct camera shot that visualises the guitarist's movements and the second one , a superimposed layer that reproduces the audio/video samples.The second layer is mirrored, being a structural detail of the piece.

The recording of immediate actions and their contrapuntal execution generates and scalar constructions in time of great precision. The organizational unit extend to a complementary resonant object made of gesture, sound and documentary actions in real and past time. The use of a numerical memory as a notation parameter equals the condition of the recording at the level of live events, except that they are mirrored symmetrically like the spinorial model, a vector model of rotation of elementary particles. The guitar is not only a sound generator but also a geographical and spatial, quasi-scene generator where the guitarist appears inside it as well as outside.

These fragments are then played back in the video by varying their speed, direction and start time (annotated on the lower line). Each color correspond to a different buffer.\nThe video is organized in two symmetrical overlapping layers, one of them is the direct camera shot that visualises the guitarist’s movements and the second one , a superimposed layer that reproduces the audio/video samples.The second layer is mirrored, being a structural detail of the piece. So the result will be a symmetrical visualisation of the real and delayed time events.</p>\n<figure class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1iMgt2G.jpeg\" alt=\"Description\">\n<figcaption>espinor,coda, ricardo cuadros pradilla</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>A complex web of three modes that rotate in a row, the sound, the gesture and the time. The recording of immediate actions and their contrapuntal execution generates and scalar constructions in time of great precision. The organizational unit extend to a complementary resonant object made of gesture, sound and documentary actions in real and past time. The use of a numerical memory as a notation parameter equals the condition of the recording at the level of live events, except that they are mirrored symmetrically like the spinorial model, a vector model of rotation of elementary particles. The guitar is not only a sound generator but also a geographical and spatial, quasi-scene generator where the guitarist appears inside it as well as outside.

Forms of agency that investigate listening, fragility, passivity and co-dependence: this our my understanding of the posthuman, the cyber and the queer. We propose \"performance\" as always relational, never individual.\n\n### CONTEXT\n\nMENTE DESNUDA is part of my encounter with the Colombian choreographer Luis Garay. With him, we have developed a liminal language between performance and experience of invented environments. We are deeply interested in the specificity of each participant. We are captivated by each encounter with the audience. We have always worked with performers with amphibious practices or self-described as Queers. We are Queers because we share what Professor Chela Sandoval calls \"consciousness of the oppressed\". Both I, as a descendant of migrants and a migrant myself, and Luis as a gay immigrant have always found allies in these bodies. At the same time we emphasise never to be defined by our place of origin, sexuality or what we would call \"identity\". How from specific and material conditions to connect with the cosmic-foreign? Here we will continue with these interests and the ensemble of 16 performers will follow these ethical and aesthetic lines. Luís and I have collaborated in my work [[mental-activity]] (2004) and in the project \"La Tierra tendrá dos soles\" (2015). We share the conviction in the importance of the idea of \"system\" over choreography and the emergent-contingent.\n\n### METHOD \n\nThe ensemble of 16 performers operates within 5 exercises for the body-voice, without ever leaving the floor. We invoke pre-human states. The idea of waiting as activity gives way to a non-linear perception of time\n\n- EXERCISE 1: ORAL RECOLLECTION Groups of 2 or 3. Recover real stories, happened in the last 24 hours. Now they are sung with specific rules of intonation and estrangement. The vocal technique alludes to the stridulation-gesang, (singing insect). One at a time (the other two listen). The body is neutral with a focus on orality.\n- EXERCISE 2: TOUCH 3 or more performers. One person \"receives\", the other(s) touch. The touchers perform a haptic exploration on the receiver. They compose an exo-voice, modulated by other bodies, generating vibratos with body touches and obfuscations. At the end, the body that received performs the \"recollection\" exercise, the other 2 observe.\n- EXERCISE 3: RECOLLECTION 1 performer. After being touched or when alone in the space. Collect the memory of the perceived touch with a bodily-phantasmal journey of what happened. Gestures and sounds are understood as ruins. Here opera becomes telepathic and non-clockwork, drama and exo-corporal singing made of accumulations of brain waves. Can a transcranial magnetism so intense that it radiates music directly into the neurons be generated from synchronous recollection?\n- EXERCISE 4: HANDS 2 performers, arms and voices. One in front of the other, what we try to generate is a magnetic field of tension between the bodies. \"Sound as a situation\", sound as a resonant string that replaces a limb of the body. Communication without understanding. A spatial granulation of synchronous emergences as waves. The greatest instrumental action.\n- EXERCISE 5: UNISON Pre-choreographed nodes, for the body as well as for the voice, can be used if the participants who meet wish to do so. The musical material of the motifs is organised by a chromatic distribution of the Missa Naray je jamais (Anonymous) filtering original dissonances in diatonic groups assigned to the nodes and sung in unisons by 4 performers.\n- ON THE IDEA OF LABORATORY AND NOT PERFORMER. The landscape seeks to constantly move participants in and out of the exercises, this seeks to map the performer and their forms when they are not \"performing\". What we are interested in is how an individual arrives at the decisions they arrive at (this is what the title NAKED MIND refers to). This methodology will produce a pre-scenic, laboratory texture. A public intimacy. About the idea of landscape and micro-exchanges between performers and between performers and audience you can refer to my latest work \"Future Technology\" (2021) indicated in the links.\n\n### ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTAL FUNCTION\n\n6 performers make up the ensemble of musical skills. Three little instruments of a homogeneous organic, in principle three trombones disassembled on the floor, their parts connected with pvc tubes. The exo-organological rule: each instrument must be activated by more than one performer.\n\nThree other performers are trained singers, the vocal style integrates the lyrical and operatic function with the vocal tract extensions that underpin the other voices. All of the performers coming from corporeal training will have some form of vocal experience and ability. Another instrumental group may consist of percussive objects of increased scale (to be investigated) such as giant euler discs (ultra-fast chirps-glissandos), 5-metre magic springs (in the manner of multi bordonas), 10-centimetre wide elastics (ultra-low frequencies) and 2 [[giants-vibraslaps]].","src/content/works/naked-mind.md","31ca806cfd201cbc",{html:1450,metadata:1451},"<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/hs6ftj5.png\" alt=\"\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9Izxhbq.png\" alt=\"\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/s58M2IC.png\" alt=\"\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AWvqtUC.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"team\">team</h3>\n<p>concept: Luis Garay\nMusic: Luciano Azzigotti</p>\n<h3 id=\"program\">program</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Speechless in the deepest and most untranslatable meaning of the expression.

Far from trying to model such experience, present in some way in baroque affect, in the representation of romantic emotion or in the quantitative nominalism of some 20th century scores, here they serve as a metaphorical pretext of formal construction. We imagine that the more hierarchical and interrelational the accumulation of layers of organization (which in their simple interaction generate a complex state), the more unpredictable and enactive will be the emergence of qualia. The movements correspond to three different configurations of the strata. They are dominated by the concepts of phase space (of the strata gesture and register), bifurcation (of style and linear planes) and chaos (chronometric density) respectively. Each of them is delimited by the instant in which one of the strata reaches its saturation level. When this occurs, the system is compensated through two operations, abrupt disintegrative cut or integrative transition. The transition functions as a method of exchange between the retentive time of qualia construction and the protentive or anticipatory time that governs the distribution of events.

Far from trying to model such experience, present in some way in baroque affect, in the representation of romantic emotion or in the quantitative nominalism of some 20th century scores, here they serve as a metaphorical pretext of formal construction. We imagine that the more hierarchical and interrelational the accumulation of layers of organization (which in their simple interaction generate a complex state), the more unpredictable and enactive will be the emergence of qualia. The movements correspond to three different configurations of the strata. They are dominated by the concepts of phase space (of the strata gesture and register), bifurcation (of style and linear planes) and chaos (chronometric density) respectively. Each of them is delimited by the instant in which one of the strata reaches its saturation level. When this occurs, the system is compensated through two operations, abrupt disintegrative cut or integrative transition. The transition functions as a method of exchange between the retentive time of qualia construction and the protentive or anticipatory time that governs the distribution of events. The disintegration, as a cadential gesture whose major power occurs in the third number.

The program defines, through the algorithmic structure that governs the macroform, the direction and variation of a pointer that intersects the image and controls numerical values.</p>",{headings:1780,localImagePaths:1790,remoteImagePaths:1791,frontmatter:1792,imagePaths:1796},[1781,1784,1787],{depth:63,slug:1782,text:1783},"principle-of-operation","Principle of Operation",{depth:155,slug:1785,text:1786},"video-generation","Video Generation.",{depth:155,slug:1788,text:1789},"about-mapping-decisions","About mapping Decisions",[],[],{title:1021,description:1767,pubDate:1793,heroImage:1769,performedBy:1771,tags:1794,performances:1795},["Date","2007-10-23T00:00:00.000Z"],[1575],[1773],[],"torrentes-extenderse.md",["Map",1799,1800],"ricardo-cuadros-pradilla",{id:1799,data:1801,filePath:1802,digest:1803,rendered:1804,legacyId:1811},{},"src/content/performers/Ricardo Cuadros Pradilla.md","ef46db3751d8e999",{html:498,metadata:1805},{headings:1806,localImagePaths:1807,remoteImagePaths:1808,frontmatter:1809,imagePaths:1810},[],[],[],{},[],"Ricardo Cuadros Pradilla.md","pages",["Map",1814,1815],"about",{id:1814,data:1816,body:1819,filePath:1820,digest:1821,rendered:1822,legacyId:1845},{title:1814,description:498,pubDate:1817,heroImage:1818},["Date","2025-12-05T00:00:00.000Z"],"https://i.imgur.com/95fxcpT.jpeg","Luciano Azzigotti's work investigates the invention of systems as aesthetic devices, exploring zones of estrangement where instruments, beings, and environments enter unstable relations.
