Luciano Azzigotti's work investigates the invention of systems as aesthetic devices, exploring zones of estrangement where instruments, beings, and environments enter unstable relations. His pieces are conceived as mutable constellations of sound, gesture, and mediated perception, unfolding through amplified instruments, installation-objects, dynamic and interactive notation, feedback systems, and expanded performance situations. Drawing from instrumental writing while continuously deforming it, his practice constructs ambiguous sonic worlds in which lyrical intensity emerges from fragile balances between control and indeterminacy, material behavior and algorithmic form. These works invite listeners into environments where time, agency, and musical form remain in constant negotiation, sharpening attention to subtle transformations and emergent behaviors.
