Trawun is a networked real-time music performance system designed for distributed cognition and collaborative sound synthesis. It uses WebSockets to connect multiple performers together, each contributing to a shared sonic environment through a minimalist text-based syntax called SYNO.

### Design Philosophy

Trawun and SYNO are designed around principles of:

1. **Minimal Interface**: Terse syntax reduces cognitive load during live performance
2. **Loose Coupling**: Modules interact via flexible interfaces, allowing "fuzzy" inputs
3. **Emergent Complexity**: Simple rules create complex sonic results through interaction
4. **Distributed Cognition**: Multiple performers contribute to a shared cognitive space
5. **Non-Deterministic Aesthetics**: Embraces "deviations, tiny errors, and fuzzy information"

## Networked Music Performance

Trawun supports distributed musical cognition through:

1. **Role-Based Participation**: Conductors can control global parameters while performers contribute individual sounds
2. **Real-Time Communication**: All sonic events are broadcast to all participants
3. **Shared Sonic Canvas**: Each performer's actions affect the collective sound space
4. **Spatial Awareness**: Normalized coordinate system maps performers in virtual space

This approach treats networked music as a form of distributed cognition where:

- Individual cognitive processes extend across multiple human actors
- The network becomes a medium for shared musical thinking
- Technology mediates between individual and collective musical expression
- The resulting music emerges from complex interactions rather than top-down design
