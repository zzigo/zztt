## Extended note

In the confines of the 19th century the decadentists aestheticize life as a form of consciousness of futility and impotence in contrast to the positivism of the time.

At the beginning of the 21st century, numerical thinking applied to art reverses the relationship: while many of the works show utility and aesthetic function, their structures resemble organic forms.

Sometimes I use systems from nature as a metaphor to construct aesthetic systems. In this work I was inspired by vilanos, the endings of certain fruits that serve for dissemination and procreation.

In the opposition between the synthetic and the organic, one imposes itself on the environment while the second creates it. Living things are not composed or carved, but simply grow. The property of growth is given by the following principle: all information required to function and replicate is supported in a cell or minimal life form. The formal principle of the work is based on this unfolding, from the non-pulmonary sounds (or "clicks") to the transfer of a feedback from inside the instrument to one with the whole. By amplifying the flute within its body each of the holes is in turn transformed into a closed tube with its own fundamental. It is in the instability of this acoustic complex from which the work is projected in an arboreal form. The arboreal systems always display the same forms regardless of the materials they are made of. They are less uniform, and present more variations in their details than the spirals or the explosions, they occupy all the space they can, like the veins, the subterranean and the rhythmic complexes approached here, built by minimal variation, fed back and mirrored. Like a strict canon that fractalizes towards infinity and returns to the surface in a toroidal space.

The amount of interfering variables is opposed to the amount of control variables, the precise notation of the embouchure, and of the configuration of the flute as a spatial translator. The repetition is not in the musical material but in the phenomenon of re-feeding. All geometry can be understood as a form of spatial constraint, between the relationship between the number of lines and points. In non-repetitive forms there are always fewer lines than points, since points are exchange connectors. In Vilanos, I tried to compose only the points of the geometry, and to make the lines and shapes emergent. This happens especially in the third section, where the interaction in hoquetus between the events of the keys, superimposed on the actions of the embouchure, generate a texture of four layers whose resultant is always changing, because of the speed of interaction of the feedback.

In a multicultural and multitemporal environment, composing with systems and their unquantifiable emergences can remind us how ridiculous any pretension of control or subjective selectivity can be. It is an anti-elitist definition of sophistication as the selective growth of any natural organism. Beyond our subjectivity. It is (to paraphrase Adorno) an unresolved antagonism of reality, which returns as an immanent problem of form.

Daniel Halaban, [Inervation and second technique in Luciano Azzigotti’s Vilanos](http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/135779) 

In this paper we aim to analyse Vilanos for two amplified flutes in C, by Argentinian composer Luciano Azzigotti, through Walter Benjamin’s concepts of “innervation” and “second technology”. We attempt to rethink these categories, which have been extensively applied to cinema, and transpose them into the reflection on music, in order to approach, from an scarcely explored perspective, a central problem of New Music: the use of electronic media.
We posit that in Azzigotti’s work the particular way the instruments are amplified -i.e.: through a condenser microphone inserted inside each flute- has a decisive role in the construction of the piece and in it’s reception. We can hear with utmost detail all key clicks, subtle changes in embochure and even feedback sounds produced due to the flute preparation.
Thus the singularities of the piece direct our attention to a specific modus of interaction between the performer’s body and the musical instrument, demanding us to reconsider Marx’s ideas about the relationship between humans and technology.
Hence what we intend is, not only to say something about Vilanos, but to contribute in providing tools to reflect on political and aesthetical implications of technology in New Music today.
