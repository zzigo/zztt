I was comissioned by Teatro Argentino to create the music of this performatic work. The ensemble of this project was conceived as a non-hierarchical integration in relation to the voices. For this it was necessary to decouple the functioning of the vocal tract (as it twas applied on the interlude [[jaquard]], organizing it from its valves and filters.
