In "1978. Sound Documentary", an installation located in Room 1, Roberto Jacoby together with Luciano Azzigotti and Nacho Marchiano address the sensation of suspended time. The work explores a double reality. On the one hand, the present of the ex-ESMA site, transformed into a space recovered and destined to memory and art; on the other hand, that repressive past that coexists in a latent form. Through an acoustic documentary that reproduces sounds of the street in the middle of the 1978 World Cup soccer match (also the silences), Jacoby puts the idea of temporal frontier in crisis.
