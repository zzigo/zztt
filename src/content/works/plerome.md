Plérôme responds to the new balance of musical instruments in the digital world. Technical objects cross borders between the micro and macro scale beyond the human. Distorted by spatial-sensors, exo-performers moulded in the fake of deep learning and virtual environments, plérôme is a declaration of a epiphylogenetic music, where the instrument is the site of inheritance and transmission.Plérôme investigates the music performance as a virtual construction where the simulation of a nano space becomes the environment where the concert is held. Plerome is a musical and performative video game that plays with borderline objects between micro and macro scales. Distorted by spatial and perceptual paradoxes, two performers move through an infinite arcade, where actions oscillate between the real ones of the percussive micro-scale and a gloomy and sarcastic virtual world of dysfunctions. Could we invent an instrument that connects us with the tesseract? The intermediate dimension between nano-space and our real geometrical environment? Plerome is inspired by this Steglerian question, whether it is possible for brains and instruments to co-evolve. The piece is dedicated to reConvert project as the third part of microbeatlogic.
