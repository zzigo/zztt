 *So I must baffle at the hint And cipher at the sign, And make much blunder, if at last I take the clew divine.* 
 
  *Emily Dickinson*



kokon is the second piece for harp I made studying differents growth phases as performing states. The harp’s resonance is like water, a fluid medium that propagates ad infinitum. Each state of the piece works as an incremental modulator of this resonance in a system where sound can be re-absorbed and feedback on its activators. It was done in close collaboration with Simon Foersters.
