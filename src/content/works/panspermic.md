Panspermia hypotheses propose (for example) that microscopic life-forms that can survive the effects of space (such as extremophiles) can become trapped in debris ejected into space after collisions between planets and small Solar System bodies that harbor life.

Similarly, using the panspermic procedure as a metaphor, the work unfolds a device where the instrument and the performatic body form a gestural continuum. Panspermic is a musical theatre research work, so its composition is based on a complex construction between light, gesture, scenic space and sound.
