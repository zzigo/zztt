Interactive sound intervention for a specific site, a place that remembers the voices that have been silenced, operating on the human voice, space and memory. 

In the courtyard of an art gallery I found a vessel, like the philasides where the ancients left written battle satires, and an ancient oil lamp. The vase has a containing function, but also an ornamental one, from the geometric period to the naturalistic epic. When someone enters the garden, there is a continuous rustling sound emitted by eight encrypted cubes surrounding the space. 

As one approaches each of the cubes, one finds that each one emits a completely distinguishable voice at the same time. As someone approaches the vase, the cubes are silenced, and the vase lights up, and a voice can be registered. 

In a first phase of interaction, the human voice is converted into a whisper by convolution, and then spatialized both in space and in a temporal grid from the beginning of the memory to the present. The duration is proportional to the intensity of the stimulus. In this second phase, a memory distributed over a very long time is composed and at the same time recorded on the web.
