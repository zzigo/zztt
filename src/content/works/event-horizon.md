EH occurs in the instant between the stimulus and the echo it
produces. All audible frequencies and the entire visible spectrum
at equal intensities. Modulated by the Curie point, the rate at which materials cease to attract each other.

The installation functions solely as a place where the materiality of the work can be produced, made up of perceptual alterations such as paraphasias and psychophonies.

## Development

The installation consists of alternating white noise through the subwoofer and white light at the strongest possible intensity, produced by a controlled strobe flash.
This modulation between sound and light is controlled by the rhythm of a Curie motor. This motor consists of 1 magnet that attracts a nickel wire. This modulation between sound and light is controlled by the rhythm of a Curie motor. This motor consists of a magnet that attracts a nickel wire.
When heated by a candle, the nickel fluctuates, loses its attractive properties, and returns to its state of rest. But as it cools, it regains its ferromagnetic capacity and is attracted again by the magnet. This
produces a natural motor whose rhythm is determined by the heat of the magnet and the amount of material. This signal is processed and translated into two states: total sound and total light, which will never coincide, generating a perceptual web of subjective correlations in each viewer.

The installation is designed to be visited by one viewer at a time. The idea is to create a space that invites meditation on the inner phenomenon of
perception in a condition that combines the logic of a clear physical operation and the sensuality of extremes that are blurred by their power.

## Materials

- a minimum space of 1.30 x 3 x 3 m

- 1 48-inch octagonal softbox or similar
- 1 2700w DMX strobe flash or the most powerful possible
mounted at a height of 1.50 m, or with an adjustable support.
- 1 chemical retort stand.
- Space painted reflecting black.
