During 2012 I collaborated with choreographer Luis Garay developing a conlang made of gestures and sounds. The piece was premiered at FIBA Buenos Aires 2011, and later it toured in Brazil and Japan. The track is a live recording of a very soupy pd patch.

In between ritual and delirium. We imagine movements as thoughts, as letters, as objects. We imagine a civilization built out of traces of traces. We imagine the space as the interior of another body. Mental exercises, that are corporeal. What if our body is just a meer part of other bodies? What is the form of inteligence? (inteligence as body skill) are we buddhas or dumbs?

ACTIVIDAD MENTAL also attempts to expose science rules are pure poetry and poetry as a science.
