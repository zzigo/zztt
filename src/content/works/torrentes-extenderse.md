Torrentes Extenderse was created using an interactive musical instrument. This instrument produces video information by capturing movements in space and transducing it into quadraphonic sound through real-time processes controlled by an algorithmic engine. The operating principle is the same as that used by Fernando Von Reichenbach in his analog graphic converter “Catalina” (1967), to whom the work is dedicated.


## Principle of Operation
 
### Video Generation.
In the interactive version, the instrument obtains information about the movements of listeners in space on the x, y, and z axes, translating them into numerical flows.
The initial conditions for macroformal generation are determined by the accumulation of events, which trace iterative grooves in the numerical curves, thus generating a shape. This triggers different generators (particles, noise, and Lindenmayer growth genes) that are modulated by the sensed information.
 
### About mapping Decisions
When transducing to sound, a mapping strategy is necessary, which in this case has been limited to the use of sinusoidal and white noise generators, leaving aside more complex modulations and sonorities. The program defines, through the algorithmic structure that governs the macroform, the direction and variation of a pointer that intersects the image and controls numerical values.
