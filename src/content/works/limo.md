While clay is an ionic bridge and marble a petrified wave, silt is the sediment of the fickle, one of the slowest and most continuous transformations on the planet. Limo is composed of a continuous process of erosion, where the hands work on multiple substrates with different velocities and timbral agents. Like the elusive substance of a rite of passage where everything is transformation and nothing is construction, the syntax of Limo is the liminal threshold, the still change. The bass drum functions as the basin where events are modulated by three forces: the feedback of connective circuits (instrumental and electrical), the combinatorial processes (of suspension, compactness, and consolidation), and the simulacrum of the sedimenting agents (water, ice, wind, temperature, and gravity) defined by the musical gesture. In the discharge of rallentandi, the limo dreams of becoming sand. An albur, listening to the core of the pleroma and the crackled voice of the rocks.
