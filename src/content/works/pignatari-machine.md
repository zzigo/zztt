Máquina Pignatari is a concrete video poem based on Decio Pignatari's concrete poem Life.
Using a 5 x 3 pixel matrix, the system creates a constructed language made up of letters, phonemes, and imaginary words.
The operating principle reinterprets the teleology of the alphabet, the set of finite audio-visual patterns that, when recombined, produce infinite meanings. In each alphabetical cycle, a new meaning is created. The operating principle
reinterprets the teleology of the alphabet, the set of finite audio-visual patterns that, when recombined, produce infinite meanings. In each alphabetical cycle, a new phrase
emerges vertically.

On 2026 an interactive online version will be launched, thanks to Templat Foundation CH.
