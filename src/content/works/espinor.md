Espinor is an extended classic guitar piece. The system consists of a contact microphone amplifying the sound of the guitar body from the bone, a webcam located behind the bridge looking towards the headstock and a PD patch processing the audio and video in real time.
The software is in charge of recording fragments of the piece indicated in the electronics staff (top line). These fragments are then played back in the video by varying their speed, direction and start time (annotated on the lower line). Each color correspond to a different buffer.
The video is organized in two symmetrical overlapping layers, one of them is the direct camera shot that visualises the guitarist's movements and the second one , a superimposed layer that reproduces the audio/video samples.The second layer is mirrored, being a structural detail of the piece. So the result will be a symmetrical visualisation of the real and delayed time events.

A complex web of three modes that rotate in a row, the sound, the gesture and the time. The recording of immediate actions and their contrapuntal execution generates and scalar constructions in time of great precision. The organizational unit extend to a complementary resonant object made of gesture, sound and documentary actions in real and past time. The use of a numerical memory as a notation parameter equals the condition of the recording at the level of live events, except that they are mirrored symmetrically like the spinorial model, a vector model of rotation of elementary particles. The guitar is not only a sound generator but also a geographical and spatial, quasi-scene generator where the guitarist appears inside it as well as outside. It was commissioned by the music area of the National Ministry of Culture for the Guitarras del Mundo festival.
