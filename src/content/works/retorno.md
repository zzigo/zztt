Echoes are like the memory of spaces. I imagined that everything that sounds remains perpetually, even if only in tiny amounts of energy, preserving a remnant of identity. It is music that advances over the remains of this memory in processes of saturation and discharge. If anything returns, it will be in the possibility of a reflection, of a scale, and of another who, by listening, reconstructs the initial action.
