Sunniva offered a compelling reflection on _Kokon_, articulating its metaphorical teleology toward an awareness of insect life and its conditions of existence:

> At tonight's concert here in Ghent, I will play Kokon by Luciano Azzigotti and honor the insects around us that are struggling. It is unacceptable that people on the street think it is "perfectly fine" for them to disappear. A 75% decline in protected areas in Germany should make everyone focus sharply. Do not remove old trees. Plant something for the insects, do it today. End of discussion.
