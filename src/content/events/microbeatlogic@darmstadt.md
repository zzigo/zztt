About:

# Trum ta’ 2.1 (2013 - 14)  
“Tables are the ground of hands”  
The hands of bipedal had to create  
their own cultural soil.  
Table is a virtual soil that contains  
all the existing tables as surfaces  
that bends about one meter from the floor.

# Weiss/Weisslich (1992 -95) Inside the cycle of concept-pieces Weiss/Weisslich. In this number 20 of this cycle  
Ablinger propose us some really clear ideas:  
two cymbals, one roll and any duration

# microbeatlogic 2 (2014)  
In the micro percussive scale, information  
is processed as a magnetic field,  
the chirp in a tone burst and the decisionof every attack  
as an accident occurring inside the rattle. Mbl2 extends this exploratory field radicalizing control  
and accident procedures. Specifically, working  
with inner sound objects. Internal sound is produced  
by objects while they serve as external sound generator  
within the container.
